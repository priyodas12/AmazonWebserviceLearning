	1.non-relational databases and distributed.
	2.does not support join.(join should be done client side)
	3.does not perform aggregation.
	4.scales horizontally.
	
DynamoDB:
	1.fully managed,highly available,3 AZ replication.
	2.scales massive workloads,distributed database.
	3.Millions of requests per seconds,100s TB of storage.
	4.Fast and consistant performance.
	5.Integrated with IAM for security,authorization and admin activity.
	
Basic of DynamoDB:
	1.made of tables
	2.each table has primary key.
	3.can infinte number or items/rows.
	4.each item has attributes can be added over time-can be null.
	5.Maximum size of an item is 400KB.
	6.Data type supported:
		1.scaler type:Number,Binary,String
		2.Document type: List,Map
		3.Set types: String set,Binary Set.
		
Primary keys:
	1A.partition key(Hash):
	2A.parimary key-->attributes.
	
	1B.partition key+sort key
	2B.user_id+game_id-->attributes
	
	
WCU and RCU:
	1.Read capacity Unit(throughput for read)
	2.Write capaccity Unit(throughput for writes)
	3.Option to set up auto-scaling of throughput to meet demand.
	4.Throughput can be exceeded temporariy using brust credit.
	5.if brust credit are empty ,will throw 
	ProvisonedThroughputException.
	
WCU:(per second always)
	one write capacity unit represents one write per second for an iteam up to 1KB.
	
	example:
		A.
		we write 10objects per seconds of 2KB each.
		
		we need 10*2=20WCU;
		
		B.
		we write 6 objects per second 4.5 KB each.
		
		we need 6*5=30 WCU;
	
RCU:
	Eventual Consistent Read: 
		if we read just after a write its possible we will get unexpected response beacuse of replication.
	Strongly Consistant Read:
		if we read just after a write and get the correct data.
	
	By Deafult Dynamo DB uses eventually consistant read.
	
	1 RCU=1 Strongly Consistant Read/Sec 
			or
		  2 Evenetually Consistant Read/Sec
		   
		  upto 4 KB
		  
	example:
		A.
		10 stringly consistant reads per seconds of 4KB each;
		
		we need 10*4/4=10RCU
		
		B.
		16 eventually consistant reads per seconds of 12 KB each;
		
		we need 16/2*12/4=24RCU
		
		C.
		10 strongly consistant reads per sec of each 6KB
		 
		we need 10*8/4=20 RCU
		
		6KB should be rounded upto nearest whole capacity 8KB.
		
DynamoDB APIs:

	1.PutItem: write date to DynamoDB.(Full replace)
	
	2.UpdateItem:Update data in Dyamo DB(partial update)
	
	3.COnditional Writes:
	Accept a write/update only if conditions are respected.
	
	4.DeleteItem: delete Individual row.
	
	5.DeleteTable: Delete whole table;
	
	6.BatchWriteItem: upto 25 PutItem/DeleteItem in a batch.
