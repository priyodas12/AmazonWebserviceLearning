Elastic Load Balancer(ELB):

	Load balancer distributess loads into te web traffic to the available server.
	
	Load balancing refers to efficient distribution incoming traffic to back end server.
	
	ELB has nothing to do with outbound traffic.
	
ELB:

	1.Application Load Balancer:
	7th layer(application layer)
	
	HTTP/HTTPS/RDP
	
	2.Network Load Balancer:static website
	4th layer(network layer)
	
	TCP/TLS/UDP
	
	3.Classic Load Balancer:
	Previous Generation worked on both 4th and 7th layer.
	
	HTTPS/HTTP/TCP/SSL
	
ELB Architechture:

	client-->load balancer DNS-->server IP-->access server
	
	
	Its not mandatorty to all trafiic will goes through Load balancer.
	
	ping command will work thotugh ICMP protocol.
	
	1.Listener:
	decides trafiic will go which particular port(80 or 443 or 3389);
	
	Frontend listener will check internet facing traffic.
	
	Backend listener configured with protocol port to check for traffic from the ELB to the EC2 instance.
	
	2.Target Group:set of server for a particular traffic;
	
	3.Target:End server or EC2 Instance or lambda or static IP(not publis IP);
	
	below are the specific IPs
	10.0.0.0/8
	100.64.0.0/10
	172.16.0.0/12
	192.168.0.0/16
	
Once you delete ELB before that you should configure Route53 to notify EC2 for desired traffic route.EC2 attached with ELB will not be deleted once ELB deleted.

ELB always send s traffic to default"eth0" additional ENI (eth1,eth2) can be created.

ELB supports only IPV4 address traffic inside VPC.

The load balancer also monitors the health of its registered instance and ensures that it route traffic only ot the healthy instances.

A halthy instance shows as Healthy under ELB
with the ELB detects Unhealthy instance it stops routing traffic to that instance.

By default AWS console uses ping HTTP (port 80) for health check.

registered instances must respond with the time out period else it will be considered as unhealthy.

AWS API uses TCP(port 80) for health check.

Default response timeout is 5 sec(2 to 60 sec);

default ping interval is default 30 sec(5 to 300 sec).

to be declared an ec2 instance unhealthy is 2(default)
