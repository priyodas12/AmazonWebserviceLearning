VPC(Virtual Private cloud):
	1.per Region max 5 VPC can be created.(not in Account)
	2.per VPC max 200Subnet we can create.
	max 200 subnet can be created.(5*200=1000 per region)
	3.5 elastic IP we can take per account.
	4.once VPC created DHCP,NACL and Security group will be created automatically.
	5.VPC will be created in Region.

Default VPC:
	1.can be deleted.(if deleted can be restored)
	2.has default CIDR,Security Grp,NACL,and ROute Table.
	3.has default Internet Gatway.
Customed VPC:
	1.As per requirement.
	2.CIDR can be decided CIDR.
	3.IG has to be created.
	
This sequence must be followed by:

Create VPC:->Create Subnet->Create IG->Create Route Table

Public Subnet:
	if a subnet having tarffice direct to IG.
	Ec2 Instance should have public IP
	
Private Subnet:
	this subnet will not have no route to IG.
	
when you create a vPC ypu must specify on IPV4 CIDR block for VPC the allowed block /16 to /28 network.

Inside subnet:these 5 will be blocked.
 suppose 10.0.0.0/16 for a subnet
	1.10.0.0.0->network address
	2.10.0.0.1->reserved by AWS for VPC route
	3.10.0.0.2->Reserved for DNS server
	4.10.0.0.3->future use
	5.10.0.0.255->direct droadcast address
	
to check public subnet->check route table->any logged IP with IG.

public and private subnet can talk inside VPC thrugh route table.

Implied Route & Route Table:

	1.200 route table/VPC
	2.50 entry/route table
	3.each subnet must be associated only one route table at a time.
	4.if you not associate with any route table by default it will be associated with default route table.
	5.main route table cant be deleted,and it can be modified.
	
	
Internet Gateway:
	1.logical entity(virtual)
	2.virtual router that connects a VPC with internet.
	3.default VPC by default attached to Interenet Gateway.
	4.it supports IPV4 and IPV6
	
NAT Gateways:(Network Address Translation):
	1.to connect private subnet to internet.
	2.installed in Public Subnet.
	3.
