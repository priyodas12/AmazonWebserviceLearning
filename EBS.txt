Types of Block Storage:

1.EBS(Elastic block Storage)-Data will not be deleted while stop or reboot.but once Terminated data will be deleted.

	A.Persistant
	B.Network Attached Virtual drive.
	C.RAW & Unformatted data Block storage.
	D.one EBS volume only can be connected to one Ec2 in one availbility ZOne.
	E.Both EBS and EC2 must be in same Availability Zone even both Availbility Zone in same Region.
	F.EBS data can be replicated by AWS in same Regoin and same Availbility Zone.
	
	
2.Instance Store.-Data will not be deleted while reboot. but once stopped or terminated data will be removed.

(Hardware(Hypervision(Virtual Machine)))

	A.Virtual Hard Drive on that host instance alloacted by EC2.
	B.Limited to 10GB per Drive.
	
	
Root/Boot Volume->Where OS installed.

Example:EBS backed EC2 or Instance Store.

EBS Volume Types:

Bootable-OS to be installed.
IOPS-INput and OUTput per second(Read and Write operation)

A.SSD(Solid State Drive)-Bootable,Throughput measured by IOPS/GB
	1.General Purpose SSD(gp2)- 
		a.Default 30GB
		b.3IOPS/GB- for 50GB 150IOPS/GB
		c.low latancy
		d.1GB to 16TB size
		e.Price depends on region.
		
	2.Provisioned IOPS(io1)-Max IPOS(64000IOPS for Nytro system)
		a.32000IOPS default
		b.4GB to 16TB
		c.for applicable for mission critical application(milisecond sensitive data-rocket lunching apps)
B.HDD(Hard Disk Drive)-Non Bootable,throughput measued by MB/sec
	1.Throughput Optimised HDD.
		a.500GB to 16TB
		b.500IOPS
		c.Big data and Warehouse
	2.Cold HDD.
		a.Lowest cost
		b.best for file servers
		c.250IOPS
		d.500GB to 16TB
C.Magnetic Standard-Bootable.
	1.Cheapest ever
	2.volumes applicable for infrequesntly accessed machine
	3.1GB to 1TB
	4.40 to 200 IOPS
	
SnapShots:
	1.Point in time image copy.
	2.stored in S3.
	3.1st time snapshot taking more time,incremtal snapshot taking less time.
	4.per account 5000EBS can be created.
	5.per account 10000Snapshot can be taken.
	i.e. per EBS to for max to max condition.
	6.EBS are Availbility Zone Specific.
	7.Snapshots are Region Specific.
	8.Any AZ in region can use snapshots to create EBS volume.
	9.to Migrate an EBS from one AZ to another,create a snapshot(region Specific) and Create an EBS volume from the snapshot in the specific AZ.
	10.you can create a snapshot to a EBS volume same on larger size than the original volume size from which the snapshot was initially created.
	11.yu can take snapshot of non-boot/not-root volume while the volume is in Running,it means we can still access while taking snapshot.
	12.SnapShots are created immediately but it may stay in Pending staus,untill full snapshot completed,may take few hours for first-time.
	13.only Non-boot volume can be acessed while taking snapshots.
	14.To take complete snapshot you have to stop root volume.(applicable for EBS)
	15.Root volume snapshot only be taken in stop stage.(for instance store you have to pause).
	
Incremental SnapShots:




Block Storage vs Object Storage:

Block Storage:
	Strong performance with database and transactional data,no metadata.

Object Storage:
	Performs best for big content and high stream throughput as Customizable metadata allows data to be easily organized and retrieved
