RDS:

	1.Field,Touple(row),Attributes(columns)
	2.Schema->Design of database
	3.can not scale out Hrizontally.(adding more server)
	4.Vertical scale out possible but costly opertion.
	5.all are in SQL.

NOSQL:
	1.Non structured.
	2.low maintaninace
	3.Faster performace in read and write
	4.Horzontal scaling possible
	5.Best of OLAP
	
Type of NoSQL:
	1.Columnar Database(HBase,Cassendra)
	2.DOcument Database(MongoDB,COuchDB)
	3.Key-Value Database(Redis,DynamoDB)
	4.GraphBase Database(Neo4J,FloackDB)
	
Multiple Availability Zone Criteria:
	1.You can select Multi AZ option when you lunch RDS.(Multi AZ cannot be decided by user).
	2.RDS creates Stand by in different AZ and in same region with synchronous update.
	primary to stand by update will be synchronous.
	3.You cannot Read/Write data in stand by database.
	4.You cannot choose any AZ where stand by will be created,once RDS is Up you can only see in which AZ its created.
	5.after failover stand by will act as primary another standby  will be created,even though last one DB instance up then also it will act as stand-by.
	6.AWS recomended for provisioned IOPS for multiple AZ.
	
FailOver cases:
	1.primary database fails
	2.in case of AZ failure.
	3.Netwrok connectivity issue with primary.
	4.loss of primary DB EC2 instance fail.
	5.EBS failure
	6.Primary database instance chnaged.
	7.Patching the OS of the DB instance.
	8.Manual failover.(reboot)
	
Multi AZ RDS failover procedure:
	1.During Failover the CNAME of the RDS DB instances is updated to map with secondary IP address.
	2.RDS endpoint does not change by Selecting Multi AZ option,However the primary and stand by instances will have different IP address,as they are in different AZ.
	3.Its not recomended that you do not use IP address for RDS.
	4.Reboot with Failover option should be seleccted for manual failver.
	
Snapshots and Back ups:
	1.whenever failover occures AWS sends 
	SNS notification(chargable)
	2.You can use API call to findout the RDS eevnts occured in last 14 days.
	3.Even you can use CLI to see last 14 days logs
	4.In AWS console we can check only for one day.
	5.In case 
			OS patching
			Syatem updates
			DB Scaling
			these things happens on stand by then on primary.
			
	6.In Multi AZ snapshots and automated back ups are done on Stand by instance to avoid IO susspension.(5 mins delay)
	
RDS multi AZ Deployment:
	1.do first on stand by.
	2.convert stand by to primary.
	3.You can manually upgrade to DB instance
	RDS->DB instance->modify DB->Set DB Engine version on maintainance window.
	
RDS Backups:
	1.AWS RDS automated back ups
	2.User insitiated Manual back ups.
	3.either you can take ups for EC2 and DB instances or both.
	4.Back ups will be stored in different AZ.
	5.Stored in Amazon S3.
	6.For no multi AZ enabled primary will be freeze while taking back ups.
	7.Back ups should be ACTIVE while taking automatic back ups.
	8.Automated back ups will not be charged but S3 storage charge will be taken.
	9.Automated back up will be deleted once RDS will be deleted.
	10.disable automatic back up->retention period to 0 days.
	11.default retention period:7 days
