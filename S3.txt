Storage:

1.Simple storage Service(unstructured data,object type)
2.Elastic File System(Common file system storage-updated,patch file,for linux based)
3.Elastic Block Storage.(EC2 attach,block level storage)
4.Glacier(durable,available and low latency data storage for archive)
5.Snowball(portable storage for data migration)

Block Level Storage->can only be accessed by EC2;

	1.structured data,random read/write data.
	2.block storage divides the data to be in evenly sized blocks for instance.
	3.metadata cannot be stored.
	4.only indexing data store to retrieve.
	
Object Level Storage-> can be access by Internet;

	1.whole object will be stored ata place not division.
	2.metadata,object global unique id
	3.dropbox,aws s3,
	

Simple Storage Service:
	1.Region Specific storage service accesible by HTTP and HTTPS
	2.Object based storage.(as it is will be stored)
	3.for OS installation S3 cannot be used.
	4.Three copis will be maintained for S3 object.
	5.Data stored in bucket(kind of folder
	and flat container i.e. under bucket there should not be another bucket).
	6.Max Bucket capacity 5TB.No limitations upto 100 Buckets/account.
	7.Can create under another folder in side Bucket by AWS console.
	
S3 Bucket Naming Convention:
	1.globally unique name.
	2.Bucket name cannot be changed once created.
	3.3 to 63 character should contain in bucket name.
	4.Service-end-point,bucketname,object name,version name.
	5.bucket name are part of URL
	6.space must be avoided,should use . in between name.
	7.Bucket name should not be an IP address.
	8.By default bucket object will be private,only owner can access.
	
Lifecycle Management:S3---after 30 days->S3-IA---after 30 days--->Glacier
	1.maintain cheaper data.
	
Satic Website hoisting:

S3 Versioning:
	1.Accidental data delete or update.
	2.Data retention and archive.
	3.versioning can not be deleted once enabled,only suspended.
	4.Versioning enabled on bucket level.
	5.delete marker will be attached once object will be enabled.
	6.incremantal data saving done.
	7.MFA s3 delete can be enabled.
	
S3 Bucket Name convention:
https://region-name.amazonaws.com/bucketName
https://s3-eu-west1.amazonaws.com/mybucket
	
S3 Multipart Upload:

	1.100MB max,parallel process.
	2.>5GB file always multi part upload.
	3.min size minimum of 0 bytes,max 5TB
	
Copying S3 Bucket:
	1.back ups
	2.Multi part upload API.
	
S3 Storage:
	1.S3 Standard(3 cpy in another AZ)
		A.High durability,Availability daily accessible data.
		B.99.9999999999% Durable
		C.99.99% available
		D.SSL Data encryption be done in flight or rest both.
		E.Storage charge high ,access charge low.
		F.Single max PUT 5GB.
	2.S3 Glacier Deep Archive:(cheapest)
		A.to archive with low cost,securly,durable max retrieval time 12 hrs
		B.Magnetic type of library.
		C.99.9999999999% Durable
		D.99.9% available
		E.75% less cose than Glacier
		
	3.S3 Standard IA(3 cpy in another AZ)
		A.Less Frequent Access ,but Rapid access.
		B.99.9999999999% Durable
		C.Storage cost cheaper(half of S3) but Access cost high.
		D.99.9% available
		E.SSL Data encryption be done in flight or rest both.
		F.Data Deleted from S3 1A within 30 days will be charged 30 days full.
		
	4.S3 Standard IA One Zone
		A.Same like S3 Standard IA but data stored in one AZ.
		B.99.9999999999% Durable
		C.99.5% available
		D.AWS will not pay any while any type of destruction.
	5.S3 Glacier
		A.to archive with low cost,securly,durable
		B.99.9999999999% Durable
		C.three retrival option available from min to hrs.
		D.SSL Data encryption be done in flight or rest both.
		E.Multiple copies will be saved in Different AZ.
		F.10GB/month data can be retrive in free tier.
	6.S3 Intelligent Tiering(3 cpy in another AZ)-data will be moved in between S3 Std(for frequent) & S3 IA(non frequent)
		A.designed to optimize cost by automatically moving data to the most cost effective Access-tier.
		B.It Works by storing objects in two tiers
		C.If an Object in the infrequest access tier is accessed,that will moved back to frequent access tier.
		D.There are no retrieval fees when using the S3 Intellegent tiering.
		E.Object less than 128KB will not be moved to IA.
		F.99.9999999999% Durable
		G.99.9% available
